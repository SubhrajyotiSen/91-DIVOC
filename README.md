**91-DIVOC** is an Android App that displays the latest gloabal stats about the COVID-19 spread. It caches data locally and periodically updates it's internal database.


### What's with the name?
It's **COVID-19** spelt backwards ðŸ˜›.

To avoid the spread of misinformation, Google stopped surfacing `COVID-19` related apps in the Play Store search results. I had to name the project something. This is the best I could come up with at 2 in the morning.
